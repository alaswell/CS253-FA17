Programming Assignment #4
CS253, Fall 2017
Due: Tuesday, Oct. 10th
“Word Stemming”
Motivation & Description

PA2 divided a text input file into whitespace-delimited strings. PA3 broke apart these strings into
word strings (which contain letters, numbers, apostrophes, and under special circumstances
periods and commas) and punctuation strings (everything else). PA3 then reported how many
times each word and punctuation string occurred. PA4 refines the word strings by word
stemming. The idea of word stemming is to remove grammatical endings from words, leaving just
the semantic stem. For example, talk, talks, talked and talking are all the same verb, just with
different endings. PA4 will stem word strings before reporting how many times each (possibly
stemmed) string occurs. In general, counts should become higher since (for example) talk, talks,
talked and talking are all stemmed to the same string, so the input “He talks and talks about
talking” would report that the string talk appeared 3 times.

This project is assigned at a point where the emphasis of the course is changing from memory
management to object oriented design. This assignment therefore has a lot of parts to it, and the
challenge is to integrate all these new rules with the code you already have from PA2 and PA3. I
recommend that you think about design. How many classes do you need, and what are their
interfaces? What methods should each class have, and how are they organized? How will you
systematically test this code? We are now reaching the point where system design, documentation
and testing become critical.

Task

As in PA3, your program will take a single file name as an argument. Any input file that was
valid for PA3 is still valid. The output is also similar: your program should write one line of
output for every unique string in the input, sorted lexicographically, followed by a space and the
number of times that string occurs. The difference between PA4 and PA3 is that now word strings
are stemmed before they are sorted and counted.

To be precise, punctuation strings are not changed. In addition, word strings that contains one or
more capital letters, one or more digits, or the ‘+’ marker are left unchanged, as are words with
two characters or less, like it or as. All other words are stemmed according to the Porter
Algorithm #2 word stemming algorithm, as defined below.(1)

Porter Algorithm #2 is an 8-step algorithm. The steps must be performed in the order given, but
every step has the same form. A Porter step is a set of grammatical suffixes, conditions and
replacements. For each step, find the longest suffix that matches the ending of the word. If the
conditions of the suffix are satisfied, remove the suffix and add the replacement. (Empty
conditions are always satisfied.) If the suffix matches but the conditions are not satisfied, do
nothing.

 (1) There are some inconsistent variations of this algorithm on the web. You must use the one described here.
 
For example, Step #3 has the suffixes eed, eedly, ed, edly, ing and ingly, but all have conditions
attached. The word agreed matches the eed suffix and satisfies its condition, namely that the
suffix is found in Region1, since Region1(agreed) = reed. Therefor agreed becomes agree. The
word seed, on the other hand, ends in eed but does not satisfy the condition (Region1(seed) is
empty), so seed remains seed, even though it also ends in the shorter ed and satisfies its
conditions.
Before listing the 8 steps, we need to establish definitions for some of the terms used in
conditions:

  • A vowel is any of {‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’} or the letter ‘y’ UNLESS the ‘y’ is the first letter
in a word or immediately follows a vowel. (Note that this is a recursive definition.)
Therefor the letter ‘y’ is considered a vowel in the word try but a consonant (non-vowel)
in the words yellow and today.

  • A double is any of the following letter pairs: {‘bb’, ‘dd’, ‘ff’, ‘gg’, ‘mm’, ‘nn’, ‘pp’, ‘rr’,
‘tt’}.

  • A valid li-ending is one of {‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’, ‘g’, ‘h’, ‘k’, ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘r’, ‘t’}.
  
  • Region1 is the substring that follows the first consonant (non-vowel) that follows a
vowel. Region1 may be empty (it often is for short words). Examples: Region1(try) is
empty, but Region1(definition) is inition.

  • Region2 is the Region1 of Region1. In other words, Region2(definition) =
Region1(inition) = ition.

  • The preceder is the part of a word before a given suffix. For example, if the suffix is ing
then the preceder of talking is talk.

  • A string ends in a short syllable if either
  
    1. It ends with a non-vowel followed by a vowel followed by a non-vowel that is
    not one of {‘w’, ‘x’ or ‘y’}

    2. The string is only two characters long, and is a vowel followed by a non-vowel
    
  • A word is called short if both (1) it ends in a short syllable and (2) its Region1 is empty.
  
    For example, bed, shed, and shred are short words, but bead, embed and beds are not.
    
Step #1 starts with a special case: if the word (i.e. string) begins with an apostrophe, remove the
apostrophe. Then apply the longest of the following substitutions that apply:


Example

With this assignment (and this assignment only) we are providing a test file and the correct output
for the test file. Note that the test file does not exercise all of the rules above, but it exercises
many of them and should get you started.

Submitting Your Work

To submit your program, first create a single tar file containing all of your source files (i.e. your
.cpp and .h files) and your makefile, but not your compiled files (no executable or .o files,
please). Then submit the tar file as PA3 on Canvas.

Grading Your Homework

To grade your assignment, the GTAs will unpack your archive in an empty directory. They will compile
your code by typing ‘make’. This command must compile your code from scratch, and it must produce an
executable called PA4 in a directory called PA4. If your code does not compile using make, you will
receive a zero for the assignment. Compiling your code should not produce any warning messages.
Although we will not deduct points for warning messages, we may in future assignments so get in the habit
of making sure you code compiles cleanly. Assuming your program compiles, it will be graded by how it
performs on test cases, including test cases with errors in the input file. If the input file contains errors, you
will receive full credit if your program returns -1 to main. (In case of an error, it should also print a
meaningful error message to std::cerr.) If the input does not contain errors, your program should return 0 to
main.

Hints

• The risk in this assignment is that you will write spaghetti code and it will get out of
hand. I would not allow any method to become longer than 15 lines. Longer methods
should be split up into shorter ones.

• This would also be a good time to think about classes. How many do you have? How
many do you need? My implementation has three classes, but your design may vary. But
if your design has one class (or worse, none), I worry.

Policies

All work you submit must be your own. You may not submit code written by a peer, a former
student, or anyone else. You may not copy or buy code from the web. The department academic
integrity policies apply.

You may not submit your program late. To receive credit, it must be submitted on Tuesday, Oct.
3rd. There is no late period. The exception is an unforeseeable emergency, for example a medical
crisis or a death in the immediate family. If an unforeseeable emergency arises, talk to the
instructor.
